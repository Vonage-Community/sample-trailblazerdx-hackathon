# Welcome to the sample-trailblazerdx-hackathon!

For this event, you need to prepare a few requirements:

- An account with Salesforce (preferably a sandbox) endowed with admin rights.

Moreover, a Vonage account is also necessary for sending and receiving messages. This account has already been set up with a funded 10DLC number to facilitate quick start-up.

## Setting up your hackathon workspace

1. Navigate to the [portal](https://neru-10ba29da-hackathon-portal-dev.use1.runtime.vonage.cloud/) to acquire a Vonage Account Credential.

2. Sign out of your personal Vonage [dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).

3. Access the Vonage [dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) once again, but now, log in with the credentials from step 1.

4. Follow this [link](Package link from Tally) to commence the installation of the Salesforce Conversation Package from Vonage.

5. Adhere carefully to the instructions provided during the course of the installation.

Once completed, you're good to start hacking!


Next instruction should be on what we want the developers to do, either send/receive SMS/MMS
